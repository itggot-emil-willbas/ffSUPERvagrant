0. Spara filen
1. git add *
2. (i rätt mapp i terminalen): git commit * -m "Ett meddelande"
3. git push origin master (filen läggs upp.)

Eller:

1git add adds your modified files to the queue to be committed later. Files are not committed
2git commit commits the files that have been added and creates a new revision with a log... If you do not add any files, git will not commit anything. You can combine both actions with git commit -a
3git push pushes your changes to the remote repository.
This figure from this git cheat sheet gives a good idea of the work flow (bild i misc-mapp)
